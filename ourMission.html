        <h2>Our Mission</h2>

        <p>
            We aim to please the different tastes of our precious customers. <br />
            In this cozy, but exquisite cafe, you can relax while enjoying a cup of fine coffee to start the day. <br />
            We also thought about our tea lovers, providing them with a large variety of flavours to choose from, <br />
            especially on a cold day to warm themselves up with. <br />
